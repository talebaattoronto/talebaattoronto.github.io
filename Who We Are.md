Talebaatil Kulliyaatul Mumenaat is a committee/sanstha to **empower** the young women of the _Dawoodi Bohra community_.  As young mumenaat we have experiences that are **exclusive to our community**. We would like to create a community of women who balance _both deen and duniya_ and foster a sense of **togetherness**.
