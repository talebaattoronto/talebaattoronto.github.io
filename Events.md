# Events 

We are in the middle of planning more events for the rest of this year so check here regularly!

### Mehndi! 

Throughout the year Talebaat hosts several mehndi nights, where anyone can buy mehndi cones and get mehndi done on their hands/feets by volunteers and Talebaat members during special miqaats. If you would like to *buy* a mehndi cone, please <a href="https://talebaattoronto.github.io/Contact Us">contact us</a> and we'll be *happy to help you*.
