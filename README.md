# Welcome to Talebaatil Kulliyaatul Mumenaat Toronto! 


> Talebaatil Kulliyaatul Mumenaat is a committee/sanstha to **empower** the young women of the _Dawoodi Bohra community_.  As young mumenaat we have experiences that are **exclusive to our community**. We would like to create a community of women who balance _both deen and duniya_ and foster a sense of **togetherness**.

Interested in becoming a part of Talebaat? Join <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPm7-Wl1pFJNAHuVkmqWu45tZK1kGvBGPGvBR0rJDJgnmfLg/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. :)
